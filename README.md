# Power Meter Pulse Gateway

> Gateway for Power Meter Pulses from ESP32 to RabbitmQ

## Configuration

Configuration is done using environment variables:

* `PORT`: Port for the HTTP endpoint (default `8080`, only change when running locally!)
* `AMQP_HOST`: RabbitMQ host
* `AMQP_USER`: RabbitMQ user
* `AMQP_PASS`: RabbitMQ password
* `AMQP_VHOST`: RabbitMQ virtual host, defaults to '/'


## Deployment

### Development

This project uses the [Micronaut Framework](https://micronaut.io/).

Version numbers are determined with [jgitver](https://jgitver.github.io/).
Please check your [IDE settings](https://jgitver.github.io/#_ides_usage) to avoid problems, as there are still some unresolved issues.
If you encounter a project version `0` there is an issue with the jgitver generator.

For local execution the configuration can be provided in a `.env` file and made available using `dotenv`:
```bash
dotenv ./mvnw mn:run
```

Note that `.env` is part of the `.gitignore` and can be safely stored in the local working copy.

## Build

The build is split into two stages:
1. Packaging with [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/)
2. Building the Docker container

This means that the [Dockerfile](Dockerfile) expects one (and only one) JAR file in the target directory.
Build as follows:

```bash
mvn --batch-mode --update-snapshots clean package
docker build .
```

The process is coded in the [docker-publish workflow](.github/workflows/docker-publish.yml) and only needs to be
executed manually for local builds.

## Contributing

PRs are welcome!

If possible, please stick to the following guidelines:

* Keep PRs reasonably small and their scope limited to a feature or module within the code.
* If a large change is planned, it is best to open a feature request issue first, then link subsequent PRs to this issue, so that the PRs move the code towards the intended feature.
